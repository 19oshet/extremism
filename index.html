			<p>This is a quiz designed to tell you how much you really know
				about extremism and extremists and the current state of the world.

				other people's beliefs.</p>
			<p>You will be asked a series of multiple choice questions about
				extremism and also about your beliefs. As this is a sensitive topic
				there will be an option to skip any question you feel uncomfortable
				answering. Some questions may have multiple answers.</p>

				on your device. We do not collect any of your data. If you choose to
				share your score your answers are not shared or stored. The only
				information we collect is a view counter.</p>
